Python Quiz - Project Brief
Introduction
Create a Python program that simulates a simple quiz application. The application will present the 
user with multiple-choice questions, collect their answers, and provide a score at the end.
Project Requirements
1. Welcome Message: Display a welcome message to the user.
#use print to display the welcome message
2. Display Questions: Show a series of multiple-choice questions (at least 5).
#Createa def with the quuestion, better performance have it in another file.py
3. User Input: Allow the user to select an answer for each question.
#
4. Calculate Score: Keep track of the user's correct answers and calculate the final score.
# create a var on 0 to track the score 
5. Display Results: Show the user's total score and a message based on their performance.

6. Data Validation: Ensure valid input by checking that the user selects an answer within the 
given choices.
7. Thank You Message: Thank the user for taking the quiz.
Example Question:
• What is the capital of France?
1. Berlin
2. Madrid
3. Paris
4. Rome
Design Considerations
• Structure your program to include clear organised functions.
• Ensure your code is modular and readable.
